## 📝 Overview
Simple plugin to avoid the respawn menu screen. Simply put, when you die, you instantly respawn.
<br>
Mainly thought for pvp and sandbox servers, where respawning occurs frequently,
<br>
and this could be a significant quality of life change.

## ⚙ Configuration
- `bool IsEnabled` - Simple switch to turn it on/off
- `bool RespawnAtHome` - Switch to automatically respawn at home, or use the regular spawning logic
